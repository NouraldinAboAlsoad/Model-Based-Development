Task 1: While Loop

Write a MATLAB script that uses a while loop to print even numbers from 2 to 20.
Create a script that calculates the factorial of a given number using a while loop. Prompt the user for input.


Task 2: Switch Statement

Write a MATLAB script to calculate the cost of a trip based on the mode of transportation. Use a switch statement to handle different cases. The modes are: car, train, bus, and airplane. Each mode has a different cost per mile.

Create a script that translates a color code into its corresponding name using a switch statement. Prompt the user for input and handle at least five different color codes.

Additional Challenge (Optional):

Extend the cost calculation script by including an input for the number of miles and then use the switch statement to calculate the total cost.
