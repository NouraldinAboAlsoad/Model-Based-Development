Objective: In this task, you will create a MATLAB program that covers various aspects of MATLAB numeric types, creating numeric arrays, using specialized matrix functions, and matrix concatenation.

Lab Tasks:

1. Cell Arrays:

Create a cell array containing various data types (numbers, text, and variables).
Access and display specific elements within the cell array.


2. Structures:

Create a simple structure to store information about a person (name, age, city).
Access and display the structure fields.


3. Character Data:

Create a character array with your name.
Concatenate your name with another character array.
Display the results.


4. Conditional Statements (If):

Write an if statement that checks if a number is even or odd.
Display a message based on the result of the if statement.


5. For Loops:

Create a for loop to generate a sequence of numbers (e.g., 1 to 10).
Display the numbers within the loop.





6. Basic Plotting:

Generate data for a simple plot (e.g., a sine wave).
Plot the data with proper labels and a legend.
