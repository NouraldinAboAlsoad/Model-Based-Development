Project Overview:In this applied learning project, you will design a temperature control system using MATLAB/Simulink, and then explore code generation and deployment using MATLAB's Embedded Coder with the Quick Start tool. This project covers the basics of MATLAB, Simulink, and the process of generating code for an embedded system. It will help you understand control systems, simulation, and how to deploy them in real-world applications.

Requirements:
1. MATLAB/Simulink installed on your computer.
2. Embedded Coder toolbox (if not included with your MATLAB installation).
3. Basic understanding of programming concepts.
4. Familiarity with Simulink modeling.

Mathematical Equation:
The temperature control system can be described by a first-order differential equation:

Where:
- T(t)is the temperature at time t..
- Tsetpoint is the desired setpoint temperature.
- τ is the time constant of the system.
- Ku is the system's gain.

Project Steps:

1. Design the Temperature Control System in Simulink:
   - Create a Simulink model to represent the temperature control system. Use blocks to simulate the system dynamics based on the provided mathematical equation.

2. Define Constants and Inputs:
   - Choose values for τ and Ku.
   - Create a step input signal (e.g., step function) as the desired setpoint temperature, Tsetpoint.

3. Simulate the Control System:
   - Run the Simulink model to observe the system's response. Verify that the control system behaves as expected.
4. Parameter Tuning:
   - Experiment with different values of τ and Ku to observe their effects on the system's response. Optimize the control parameters for the desired performance.

5. Generate Code using Embedded Coder:
   - Configure Embedded Coder for code generation (e.g., target hardware, build options).
   - Use the Quick Start tool to guide you through the code generation process.

6. Code Generation and Deployment:
   - Execute the code generation process from the Quick Start tool. You will obtain source code files in the programming language (e.g., C or C++) you specified.
   - Follow the provided guidelines to deploy the generated code onto your target hardware or simulation environment.

7. Verification on Target Hardware:
   - Run the temperature control system on your target hardware or simulation platform to validate its functionality.

8. Report and Documentation:
   - Prepare a report summarizing your project, including details of the Simulink model, the temperature control system's behavior, the code generation process, deployment results, and your observations and findings.

This project provides hands-on experience in designing a control system with a first-order differential equation, simulating it in Simulink, generating code for embedded systems using Embedded Coder and the Quick Start tool, and deploying the system on target hardware or simulators. It's an excellent way to understand the process of transitioning control algorithms to embedded platforms.
