Objective: In this lab, you will gain hands-on experience with fundamental Simulink blocks and learn how to create a simple simulation model.

Requirements: MATLAB and Simulink installed on your computer.

Lab Tasks:

Part 1: Setting Up the Model

Launch MATLAB and open Simulink.
Create a new Simulink model.
Save the model with an appropriate name.

Part 2: The Product Block

 Drag and drop a Product Block from the Simulink library to your model.
Connect two Constant Blocks (with values 3 and 4) to the Product Block's inputs.
Add a Display Block to view the output.
Run the simulation to see the result.


Part 3: The Gain Block


      8. Remove the Product Block.
      9.Drag and drop a Gain Block to your model.
     10.Connect one of the Constant Blocks (value: 5) to the Gain Block's input.
     11.Add a Display Block to visualize the output.
     12.Run the simulation.


Part 4: The Sum Block


     13. Remove the Gain Block.
     14.Add a Sum Block to the model.
     15.Connect two Constant Blocks (values: 7 and 2) to the Sum Block's inputs.
     16.Add a Display Block to see the sum.
      17.Run the simulation.


Part 5: The Constant Block

      18. Remove the Sum Block.
      19.Drag and drop a Constant Block to the model.
      20.Set the value to 10.
      21.Connect the Constant Block to a Display Block.
      22.Run the simulation.


Part 6: The Display Block

23. Remove the Constant Block.
24.Add a Display Block to the model.
25.Connect a Constant Block (value: 8) to the Display Block's input.
26.Run the simulation to observe the displayed result.
