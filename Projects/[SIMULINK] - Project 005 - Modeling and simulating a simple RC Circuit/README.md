Mathematical Equation:
The voltage across a charging or discharging capacitor in an RC circuit can be described by the following first-order differential equation:

Where:
VC(t) is the voltage across the capacitor as a function of time.
R is the resistance in ohms.
C is the capacitance in farads
Vin(t) is the input voltage as a function of time.
Choose values for R,C, and the input voltage Vin(t). For example, you can use R=1 kohm,C=1 µF, and Vin(t)=5sin(2πt) volts.
Create a Simulink model to represent the RC circuit. Use blocks for the input voltage, resistor, and capacitor, and visualize the results using a scope block

Develop a MATLAB script that defines the system parameters to solve the differential equation and plots Voltage over time.
