Project Description:
This applied learning project focuses on simulating the motion of a simple pendulum using MATLAB and Simulink. The project is designed to help you grasp the fundamentals of MATLAB and Simulink, including modeling and simulating dynamic systems.


Requirements: 

Mathematical Equation:
We will mode a simple pendulum governed by the differential equation for angular displacement θ(t):
L⋅θ¨(t) + g⋅sin(θ(t)) = 0
Where:
L is the length of the pendulum (meters).
θ¨(t) is the angular acceleration (radians/second²).
g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s²).
θ(t) is the angular displacement from the vertical position (radians).



System Parameters: 
Assign values to the system parameters: L (length of the pendulum) and g (acceleration due to gravity). Typical values could be L=1 meter and g=9.81 m/s².


MATLAB Script: 
Develop a MATLAB script that defines the system parameters to solve the differential equation.
The script should generate plots of angular displacement and angular velocity over time.
Utilize MATLAB functions for numerical integration and plotting.


Simulink Model: 
Create a Simulink model that replicates the behavior of the simple pendulum based on the provided equation and parameters.
Configure blocks in Simulink to represent the pendulum and its motion.


Additional Detalis: 
You can enhance the project by considering factors like initial angular displacement, initial angular velocity, or damping effects.
Analyze and visualize the pendulum's motion under different initial conditions and parameter variations.
This project provides hands-on experience with numerical simulations, dynamic system modeling, and integration between MATLAB and Simulink.

For the "Simple Pendulum Motion Simulation" project, you are required to create a script file in MATLAB/Simulink that runs the simulation five times with different values of the length l. After each simulation run, you need to plot and visualize the results.
